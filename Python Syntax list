Indentation: Python uses whitespace (usually four spaces) for code indentation. Proper indentation is crucial for defining code blocks, like loops and functions.

Comments: Comments are created using the # symbol and are used for adding explanations to your code. They are ignored by the interpreter.

Variables: Variables are created by assigning a value to a name. Python is dynamically typed, so you don't need to declare the variable type explicitly.

Data Types: Python supports various data types, including integers, floats, strings, lists, dictionaries, and more. Type conversions can be done using functions like int(), float(), and str().

Operators: Python supports a wide range of operators, including arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (>, <, ==), and logical operators (and, or, not).

Conditional Statements: Python uses if, elif, and else to create conditional statements. Indentation determines code blocks.

Loops: Python has for and while loops for iteration. The for loop can iterate over sequences, while the while loop continues as long as a condition is met.

Functions: You can define functions using the def keyword. Functions can accept parameters and return values using return.

Lists and Dictionaries: Lists are created with square brackets [], and dictionaries with curly braces {}. They store collections of data.

Exception Handling: Python uses try, except, finally blocks for error handling. It allows you to gracefully handle exceptions.

Modules and Libraries: Python allows you to import modules and libraries using the import statement to extend its functionality. For example, import math allows you to use math functions.

Print Statement: You can use the print() function to display output in Python. For instance, print("Hello, World!") will print the specified text.

String Concatenation: Python uses the + operator to concatenate strings. For example, str1 + str2 combines two strings into one.

String Formatting: You can format strings using placeholders like %s for strings and %d for integers or using f-strings like f"Hello, {name}".

Lists and Indexing: Lists in Python are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is accessed with [0]. You can access elements from the end using negative indices.

Tuples: Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable. They are defined using parentheses, for example, (1, 2, 3).

Boolean Values: Python has boolean values True and False, used in logical operations and comparisons.

File Handling: You can open, read, write, and close files in Python using functions like open(), read(), write(), and close().

Classes and Objects: Python supports object-oriented programming. You can define classes and create objects to model real-world entities.

Lambda Functions: Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, can be created using the lambda keyword. They are used for small, one-time tasks.

Recursion: Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It's a powerful way to solve problems like factorials or traversing data structures.

Global and Local Variables: Python distinguishes between global and local variables. Global variables are defined outside functions and can be accessed throughout the program, while local variables are specific to a function.

List Comprehensions: List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. For example, [x for x in range(10)] generates a list of numbers from 0 to 9.

Slicing: Slicing is used to extract a portion of a sequence (like a list or string) by specifying start and end indices. For instance, my_list[2:5] retrieves elements from index 2 to 4.

Sets: A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are defined with curly braces and can be used for tasks like removing duplicates from a list.

Object-Oriented Concepts: Python supports inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, which are core concepts in object-oriented programming.

Decorators: Decorators are a way to modify or enhance the behavior of functions. They are often used for tasks like logging or authentication.

Generators: Generators are a type of iterable that can be used to iterate over large datasets efficiently. They are defined using functions with the yield keyword.

List Methods: Python lists have several built-in methods for manipulation, like append(), remove(), and sort().

Regular Expressions: Regular expressions (regex) are used for pattern matching in strings. Python provides the re module for working with regex patterns.
