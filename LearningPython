#This Python code defines a dictionary named students with keys "male" and "female," each associated with a list of names. The code then iterates over the keys of the dictionary ("male" and "female") using a nested loop. 
#Inside the nested loop, it further iterates over the names in the corresponding list.
# 
# The conditional statement (if "a" in name) checks if the letter 'a' is present in each name. If a name contains the letter 'a,' it prints that name using the print statement.
# 
# In summary, the code loops through the dictionary of students, checks each name for the presence of the letter 'a,' and prints the names that meet this criterion.

#Here the dictionary named students is created.
students = {
    "male":["Tom", "Charlie", "Harry"],
    "female":["Sarah", "Huda", "Samantha"]
}
for key in students.keys():
    for name in students[key]:
        #the below code only prints out the names that have the letter a in the their name.
        if "a" in name:
            print(name)

# In Python, list comprehension is a concise way to create lists. 
# It allows you to define a list and specify the conditions for including elements in that list in a single line of code. 
# The general syntax is [expression for item in iterable if condition].
# 
# Now, let's break down the provided code:


even = [x for x in range(1, 101) if x % 2 == 0]
print(even)

# even is the name of the list that will be created using list comprehension.
# 
# [x for x in range(1, 101) if x % 2 == 0]: This is the list comprehension expression. Let's break it down further:
# 
# for x in range(1, 101): It iterates over each value of x in the range from 1 to 100 (inclusive).
# 
# if x % 2 == 0: It checks whether the current value of x is even (divisible by 2).
# 
# x: The expression to be included in the list if the conditions are met. In this case, it's the variable x.
# 
# Putting it all together, this list comprehension creates a list (even) containing all even numbers from 1 to 100.
# 
# print(even): Finally, the print statement displays the resulting list of even numbers.
