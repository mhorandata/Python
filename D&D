#Dungeons and Dragons code randomizer
#This code is to practice coding and to potentially help with playing the game dungeons and dragons.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# import random allows you to use randomized data.
# random.randint below is used for randomizing integers.

import random
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#There should only be one import random. If the one at the top is missing or commented out uncomment this one
#when using this code.
# import random

# Generate a random integer once (only rolls the dice one time to generate a number between 1 and 20).

# mylist = [random.randint(1, 20)]
# print(mylist)
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#This longer version is for if you want the dice to roll more than once.
#In Python, the "def" keyword is used to define functions.
# Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task.
# When you see "def" in code, it signifies the beginning of a function definition.

# def fucntname():
#     return random.randint(1, 2)

# This is where the list is created and the range of random numbers from 1 to 20 is selected.

# mylist = [random.randint(1, 20) for _ in range(fucntname())]
# This prints or displays the results in the console.

# print(mylist)

# Comment import random out if it is uncommented at the top.

#they won't choose to roll dice numbers that will lead to problems.

#user to pick from an option available on the list.
