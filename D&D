#Dungeons and Dragons code randomizer
#
#The code below is to practice coding and to potentially help with playing the game dungeons and dragons.
#
# Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a tabletop role-playing game that allows players to create their own characters and embark on adventures in a fantasy world.
# The game is played with a set of rules that govern how the game is played and how characters interact with the world around them.
# The Basic Rules for Dungeons & Dragons is a free PDF that covers the core of the tabletop game. It includes information on the various races, classes, backgrounds,
# equipment, and other customization options that you can choose from. The Basic Rules document is divided into four parts. Part 1 is about creating a character,
# providing the rules and guidance you need to make the character youâ€™ll play in the game. Part 2 details the rules of how to play the game, beyond the basics described
# in this introduction. That part covers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine success or failure at the tasks your character attempts, and describes the three broad
# categories of activity in the game: exploration, interaction, and combat. Part 3 is all about magic. It covers the nature of magic in the worlds of D&D, the rules for spellcasting,
# and a selection of typical spells available to magic-using characters (and monsters) in the game. Part 4 is about tools for Dungeon Masters. It includes information and stat blocks
# for monsters, advice for building combat encounters, and magic items. You can find the Basic Rules from the official Dungeons & Dragons website.

# import random allows you to use randomized data.
# random.randint below is used for randomizing integers.

import random
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#There should only be one import random. If the one at the top is missing or commented out uncomment this one
#when using this code.
# import random

# Generate a random integer once (only rolls the dice one time to generate a number between 1 and 20).

# mylist = [random.randint(1, 20)]
# print(mylist)
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#This longer version is for if you want the dice to roll more than once.
#In Python, the "def" keyword is used to define functions.
# Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task.
# When you see "def" in code, it signifies the beginning of a function definition.

# def fucntname():
#     return random.randint(1, 2)

# This is where the list is created and the range of random numbers from 1 to 20 is selected.

# mylist = [random.randint(1, 20) for _ in range(fucntname())]
# This prints or displays the results in the console.

# print(mylist)
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#This section of code allows you to roll multiple various kinds of common D&D dice you choose.
# Comment import random out if it is uncommented at the top.

import random

#The funciton get_under_input is created here. It asks the user to enter an integer number for rolls of the dice.

def get_user_input():
    return int(input("Enter the number of rolls: "))

#These are the typical dice options for D&D. This sets up a list for the user to choose which dice
#option they want to roll.

options = [20, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4]

#This resets the variable max_range prior to the user choosing which dice to roll so that any prior
#operations of this code won't cause conflicts with it running currently.

max_range = None

#This while loop makes it so that the user has to choose one of the dice options from the list so that
#they won't choose to roll dice numbers that will lead to problems.
#If they try entering a number outside the list it will cause a message to pop up and ask the
#user to pick from an option available on the list.

while max_range not in options:
    max_range = int(input("Enter the dice number to roll out of 20, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4: "))
    if max_range not in options:
        print('Not a valid dice size. Try again with 20, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4.')

#The varaible get_user_input from above when the user input a number for the rolls
#The new num_rolls variable is made equal to the value of the get_user_input function.

num_rolls = get_user_input()

#A loop is started here that for each dice roll the user chose a random value between 1 and the
#dice value they selected (the max_range or highest dice value) is printed to the console.

for i in range(num_rolls):
    print(random.randint(1, max_range))
    #     print(max_range)
