#Here is an example of how a class works using the analogy of a cookie cutter and cookies.
#The class is the cookie cutter and by building it's structure the cookies can use that
#to get the basic shape and reuse it with variations.
#The Class ClassName: def __init__(self, parameterName): is the basic setup to the start of a class.
#the self.parameterName = parameterName sets up the parameter to be references with the class.
#self is used to reference the current class. It is customary to use self as the first parameter.
#self enables you to modify an object's properties and execute tasks unique to that particular instance.
class Cookie:
    def __init__(self, cookieColor):
        self.cookieColor = cookieColor

#In Python a methond is like a funciton but it is part of another object (like a class).
#There are two methods (functions) within this class (get_color and set_color).
#Notice the keyword self is used to indicate you are referencing a class.
#The return keyword is used to pass information (save it for later) from a funciton (or method)
#to a variable or parameter so that the variable or parameter will have that value
#later when needed (to print the value to the user for instance).
    def get_color(self):
        return self.cookieColor

    def set_color(self, cookieColor):
        self.cookieColor = cookieColor

#Here is where the cookie cutter cuts individual cookies in our analogy.
#The cookie cutter class Cookie is used to "Cut" (create) individual instances ("cookeis")
#and these cookies are then given a string value of green and blue.
cookie_one = Cookie('green')
cookie_two = Cookie('blue')


#Finally here is where the cookies are shown to the user (they are printed).
print('Cookie one is ', cookie_one.get_color())
print('Cookie two is ', cookie_two.get_color())
