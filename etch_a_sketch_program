#
# ```python
# from turtle import Turtle, Screen
# ```
# - This line imports the `Turtle` class and the `Screen` class from the `turtle` module. These classes are used for creating a turtle graphics window and a turtle object.
#
# ```python
# tim = Turtle()
# ```
# - This line creates an instance of the `Turtle` class and assigns it to the variable `tim`. This turtle will be used to draw on the screen.
#
# ```python
# screen = Screen()
# ```
# - This line creates an instance of the `Screen` class and assigns it to the variable `screen`. The screen is where the turtle will draw.
#
# ```python
# def move_forwards():
#     tim.forward(10)
#     tim.pencolor("red")
# ```
# - This defines a function named `move_forwards` that makes the turtle (`tim`) move forward by 10 units when called.
#      the pencolor("red") makes the line red as it moves
#
# ```python
# def move_backwards():
#     tim.backward(10)
#     tim.pencolor("red")
# ```
# - This defines a function named `move_backwards` that makes the turtle (`tim`) move backward by 10 units when called.
#      the pencolor("red") makes the line red as it moves
#
# ```python
# def turn_left():
#     new_heading = tim.heading() + 10
#     tim.setheading(new_heading)
# ```
# - This defines a function named `turn_left` that changes the turtle's heading (direction it's facing) to the left by 10 degrees.
#
# ```python
# def turn_right():
#     new_heading = tim.heading() - 10
#     tim.setheading(new_heading)
# ```
# - This defines a function named `turn_right` that changes the turtle's heading to the right by 10 degrees.
#
# ```python
# def clear():
#     tim.clear()
#     tim.penup()
#     tim.home()
#     tim.pendown()
# ```
# - This defines a function named `clear` that clears the turtle's drawing, lifts the pen, moves the turtle to the home position (center of the screen), and puts the pen down.
#
# ```python
# screen.listen()
# ```
# - This makes the screen listen for events like key presses.
#
# ```python
# screen.onkey(move_forwards, "w")
# screen.onkey(move_backwards, "s")
# screen.onkey(turn_left, "a")
# screen.onkey(turn_right, "d")
# screen.onkey(clear, "c")
# ```
# - These lines bind the functions to specific keys. When the user presses "w," the `move_forwards` function is called, and similarly for "s," "a," "d," and "c."
#
# ```python
# screen.exitonclick()
# ```
# - This allows the program to exit gracefully when you click on the turtle graphics window.
#
# I hope this breakdown helps you understand each part of the code. If you have any specific questions or need further clarification on any part, feel free to ask!
