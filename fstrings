#**F-strings** are a way to format strings in Python 3.6 and later versions. They are a concise and readable way to embed expressions inside string literals for formatting. To create an f-string, prefix the string with the letter `f`. The string itself can be formatted in much the same way that you would with `str.format()`. 

# For example, let's say you want to print a message that includes a user's name and age. You could use an f-string like this:

# ```python
# name = "John"
# age = 25
# print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
# ```

# This will output:

# ```
# My name is John and I am 25 years old.
# ```

# F-strings are useful when you want to include variables or expressions inside a string. They can be especially helpful when you need to format user input as part of a string. 
#For example, if you want to ask a user for their name and then use that name in a message, you could use an f-string like this:

# ```python
# name = input("What is your name? ")
# print(f"Hello, {name}!")
# ```

# This will output:

# ```
# What is your name? John
# Hello, John!
# ```
