# **F-strings** are a way to format strings in Python 3.6 and later versions. They are a concise and readable way to embed expressions inside string literals for formatting. To create an f-string, prefix the string with the letter `f`. The string itself can be formatted in much the same way that you would with `str.format()`. 

# Here is an example of an f-string:

# ```python
# name = "John"
# age = 25
# print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
# ```

# This will output:

# ```
# My name is John and I am 25 years old.
# ```

# You can also use expressions inside the curly braces to perform operations or call functions. Here is an example:

# ```python
# num1 = 10
# num2 = 20
# print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 + num2}.")
# ```

# This will output:

# ```
# The sum of 10 and 20 is 30.
# ```

# I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
