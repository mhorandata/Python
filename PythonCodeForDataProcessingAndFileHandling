# Python Code for Data Processing and File Handling
class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self, filename):
        # Initializes the class with the provided filename
        self.filename = filename
        # Sets a placeholder variable_name, replace with the actual variable name
        self.variable_name = "example_data"

    def process_data(self):
        # Performs data processing and creates a formatted string
        processed_data = f"Processed data: {self.variable_name}"

        # Opens the file in write mode ('w') using 'self.filename'
        with open(self.filename, 'w') as data:
            # Writes the processed data to the file using data.write and f-string formatting
            data.write(f"{self.variable_name}: {processed_data}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Creates an instance of DataProcessor with the filename 'example.txt'
    processor = DataProcessor('example.txt')

    # Processes data and writes to the file
    processor.process_data()

# Code Breakdown:
#1. class DataProcessor: Defines a class named DataProcessor, serving as a container for data processing and file handling methods.
#2. init: Constructor method that initializes the class with the provided filename and a placeholder for the variable name.
#3. process_data: Method for performing data processing, creating a formatted string, and writing the result to the file.
#4. if name == "main": Conditional statement ensures the code is executed only when the script is run, not when imported.
#
# Jargon Explanation:
#* f-string: Formatted string literals allow embedding Python expressions inside strings using the 'f' or 'F' prefix.
#* self: Refers to the instance of the class, making it clear which instance variable or method is being referred to.
#* `data.write(f"{self.variable_name}"): Writes the formatted variable to the file using the file handle 'data'.
#
# This code creates a DataProcessor instance, processes data, and writes it to a file. Adjust the filename and variable_name as needed.

#1. File Operations Overview:
# File handling in Python is crucial for working with external data. It involves operations like reading from and writing to files. Think of a file as a container that stores information, and file handling as the way Python interacts with this container.
#
#2. Opening a File:
#
# In Python, the open() function is used to open a file.
# The 'r' mode stands for read, allowing you to access the content of a file.
# Similarly, 'w' mode is for writing, creating a new file or overwriting an existing one.
#3. Types of Files:
#
# Text files store character data, like plain text (test.txt).
# Binary files store binary data, such as images or multimedia.
#4. Data Processing:
#
# Once a file is open, you can perform operations on its content.
# Reading from a file involves extracting information, while writing allows you to add or modify data.
#5. Closing the File:
#
# It's essential to close the file after processing using with open(...) as file:. This ensures resources are properly managed.
#6. Error Handling (Optional):
#
# Adding error handling with try and except blocks is good practice to handle potential issues during file operations.
#
# In Python, file paths are crucial for data processing and file handling. Understanding the difference between relative and absolute paths is essential:
#
# Absolute File Path:
# Describes the full path to a file or directory, starting from the root folder.
# Example: /home/user/documents/data.txt.
# Useful when the exact location from the root directory is needed.
#
# Relative File Path:
# Describes the path to a file or directory relative to the current working directory of the Python script.
# Example: ./documents/data.txt or ../images/picture.jpg.
# Convenient when referring to files within the project structure.
# When processing data or handling files in Python, choosing between absolute and relative paths depends on the scenario.
# If portability across systems is essential, relative paths are often preferred. They make it easier to manage project structures and
# share code without worrying about specific directory structures.

# with open("/Users/LondonAppBrewery/Desktop/new_file.txt") as file:
#     contents = file.read()
#     print(contents)
#
#1. The code opens a file located at "/Users/LondonAppBrewery/Desktop/new_file.txt" using the with open(...) statement.
#2. The as file part assigns the opened file to the variable named file.
#3. contents = file.read() reads the entire content of the file and stores it in the variable contents.
#4. Finally, print(contents) prints the content of the file to the console.
#
# This code snippet is a common pattern for reading the contents of a text file in Python.

# Original string
# txt = "I like bananas"
#
# # Replace "bananas" with "apples"
# x = txt.replace("bananas", "apples")
#
# # Print the modified string
# print(x)
# 
#1. txt = "I like bananas" initializes a string variable txt with the value "I like bananas".
#2. x = txt.replace("bananas", "apples") uses the replace() method on the string txt to replace all occurrences of "bananas" with "apples". The result is stored in the variable x.
#3. Finally, print(x) prints the modified string x to the console.
# This code demonstrates the use of the replace() method in Python, which is commonly used to replace specific substrings within a string.
