# 
# Let's break down the code line by line for a beginner:
# 
# def reverse(self):
# 
# Defines a function named reverse that takes an instance of a class (self) as its first parameter.
# temp = self.head
# 
# Creates a temporary variable temp and assigns it the value of the current head of a linked list (self.head).
# self.head = self.tail
# 
# Sets the head of the linked list to be the current tail, effectively swapping the head and tail.
# self.tail = temp
# 
# Sets the tail of the linked list to be the temporary variable (temp), completing the swap.
# after = temp.next
# 
# Creates a variable after and assigns it the value of the next node after the current temporary node (temp).
# before = None
# 
# Initializes a variable before and assigns it None. This will be used to reverse the links in the linked list.
# for _ in range(self.length):
# 
# Starts a loop that iterates self.length times. This loop is used to reverse the links in the linked list.
# after = temp.next
# 
# Updates the after variable to store the next node after the current temporary node (temp).
# temp.next = before
# 
# Reverses the link of the current temporary node (temp) by pointing its next to the before node.
# before = temp
# 
# Updates the before variable to be the current temporary node (temp) for the next iteration.
# temp = after
# 
# Updates the temporary node (temp) to be the next node (after) for the next iteration.
#
# This code essentially reverses the direction of the links in a linked list, 
# effectively reversing the order of the elements in the list.
