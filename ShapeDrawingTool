# Example usage:
#Comment out any shapes you don't want the program to draw.
draw_shape(3)  # Draw a triangle with a random color
draw_shape(4)  # Draw a square with a random color
draw_shape(5)  # Draw a pentagon with a random color
draw_shape(6)  # Draw a hexagon with a random color
draw_shape(8)  # Draw an octagon with a random color
draw_shape(10)  # Draw a decagon with a random color
# You can keep adding draw_shape calls, and it will randomize the colors.
